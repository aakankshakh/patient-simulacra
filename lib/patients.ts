    description: `You are a previously healthy 27 year-old woman. You have been having chest discomfort about
twice a week for the last 2 weeks. It is sharp, associated with difficulty getting a deep breath. It
seems to come on mostly at work or when you are driving. It lasts about a half-hour at a time.
You've tried Tylenol, Advil, drinking cold water, and antacids without much benefit. It doesn't
radiate. It is severe enough to interrupt your work but not excruciating. You haven't had any
heartburn or stomach symptoms. You are concerned that it could be a heart problem.
You smoke 15 cigarettes a day. You're trying to quit; had cut down from 1 pack/day to ½ pack
but recently went back up to ¾ PPD, 'probably from stress.' No drug use. You've never been in
the hospital or been told you had any chronic illnesses, never had anything like this before, never
had a cholesterol test.
You are separated from your husband of two years, which is very stressful. You had argued a lot
and just grown apart, no history of domestic violence. You work as a bank supervisor, no
children, not currently sexually active or using birth control. You do aerobics 3-4 times a week
and haven't had any problems with chest pain or breathing while exercising; 'Actually that's
when I feel best.'
Your father had a heart attack last year when he was 64, which is one of the reasons you are
worried about these pains. He also smokes and has high blood pressure. Your mother and older
brother are healthy.
You take a multivitamin daily, no other meds, no allergies`,

    description: `You are a 27-year old man, self-employed as a carpenter, and have always been 'healthy as a
horse.' This weekend you were helping a friend move, including carrying a very heavy sleeper-
sofa up 2 flights of stairs.
Yesterday you woke up with bad pain in your right lower back; you could hardly get out of bed.
You took some aspirin and a hot shower, which loosened it up enough to go to work. It got more
and more painful; you barely made it through the day. Another hot shower and aspirin helped
when you got home.
This morning it was really stiff again; there's no way you can go through another day like
yesterday.
You have an associates degree from the local state university. You smoke about a pack of
cigarettes per day, with no real interest in quitting, and marijuana about once a week, again with
no real interest in quitting. You have had about 14 lifetime sexual partners and just started dating
someone seriously. You play softball and volleyball in a tavern league. You drink beer on the
weekends, maybe 6-10 a night.
Your older brother is disabled from a back injury (he was a fireman in a burning building that
collapsed); you have no disability insurance and are really scared that you will end up disabled.
Your father has high blood pressure.
You expect the doctor to do some tests and order an MRI to know exactly what is going on and
make sure it gets better. You will ask “Are you sure it's not a slipped disk?” if symptomatic
treatment is suggested initially, and request an MRI. You will agree to symptomatic treatment
and monitoring if the rationale is presented adequately.`,

    description: `You are a 17-year old guy. You've had trouble with coughing and not being able to run very far
for a couple of years. Your gym teacher is always like, get moving, and it's like, dude, I can't
breathe, you know?
You saw this new doctor here 2 months ago. You told her that you had had asthma when you
were a kid but had not had any problems for several years. She did a test where you breathed into
a tube, and said it looked like your asthma had come back.
You were really bummed about that and really didn't hear everything else she said. You were
thinking that sucks 'cause you had been thinking of maybe trying to join the Marines and you
heard you can't have asthma. The doctor gave you a sample of an albuterol inhaler, which you
could really feel open up your lungs and help right away. That was awesome! You've been using
that once or twice a day but forgot it in the car 'cause your stupid metal shop teacher wouldn't let
you leave school on time.
The doctor gave you a prescription for another inhaler but you kind of thought it was only if the
albuterol wasn't working, so you haven't filled that prescription. She gave you a peak flow meter
too but you thought that was only for when you couldn't breathe, so you haven't used that at all.
You noticed that it seems like going out in the cold makes your chest feel tight. That sucks
'cause your girlfriend wanted to build a snowman and do snow angels and you had to go in the
house and she was like, you're such a bummer and I was like, Dude I can't breathe, you know?
Last week you were over by a friend's house where they have, like, a hundred cats, and you
totally started wheezing, and it was like, Dude, I totally thought I was gonna die!
Other than that, you're feeling great and really happy about how things are going.
You're still wondering about if you can join the Marines though.`,
